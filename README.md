CellStart Landing Page Mockup
This repository contains a single-page HTML mockup for the CellStart brand's ChronoNAD+ product. This project was created as part of a web developer internship assignment for Dislapharm & CellStart.

Assignment Overview
The goal of the assignment was to create a self-contained, responsive landing page that showcases the ChronoNAD+ product. The page was required to be built using a single HTML file with no external network dependencies (no CDNs, no external stylesheets or scripts). All CSS, JavaScript, and images were to be inlined or embedded within the HTML document.

The page includes:

Hero Section: A main banner with a headline, subtext, and a call-to-action button.

Additional Sections: Two custom sections that highlight the product's benefits and features, based on the provided brand data.

Technical Implementation
The entire page is built within a single mockup.html file to meet the assignment's "self-contained" requirement.

HTML & CSS: The page is structured using semantic HTML. All styling is done using raw CSS within a <style> tag in the <head> of the document. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and pleasant user experience across different screen sizes.

Fonts: The specified fonts, Cabin and Poppins, are imported from Google Fonts, which is a rare exception for this type of assignment, however, since the assignment mentioned "no network/CDN dependencies," I decided to use base64 for all fonts.

Images: All images and logos are embedded directly as base64 encoded data URIs within the CSS and HTML, eliminating any external image requests.

JavaScript: While the page is primarily static, a minimal amount of JavaScript could be used for interactive elements like the "Shop Now" button or simple animations.

How to View the Mockup
To view the landing page, simply open the mockup.html file in any modern web browser. Since it is a self-contained file, no local server or additional setup is required.

Reflection
This assignment was a great exercise in core web development principles. It required a deep understanding of HTML and CSS to create a professional, responsive design without relying on modern frameworks. It also provided a valuable opportunity to demonstrate an ability to adhere to specific technical constraints while maintaining creative freedom.
